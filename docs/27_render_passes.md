# Render Additional Passes

1. Run the steps necessary to render a final image but without the hero asset (espresso machine).
2. Then take the result of that rendered image back into your kit based app and map that to a mesh ( plane, cylinder, projection etc...)
3. With this in place you can now render the hero asset with the reflections baked in.
4. Send this result back to do a second pass with the same prompt or re-composite in ComfyUI
5. Now the hero asset should have nicer reflections baked in.
