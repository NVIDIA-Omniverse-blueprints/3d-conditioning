# Augmentation Results and Analysis

The examples below demonstrate generations from the sample images with the RealViz4 model. This model is a finetune on the base SDXL model, with an emphasis on photographic quality. Additionally, this model is a lightning model, (distilled) to perform much faster than the base SDXL model. As always, check the licenses on the models you choose to ensure your use is compliant.

### **USD Code and USD Search**


*Optional*

Optionally, you can integrate USD Code and USD Search to enable users to build scenes to place your configurable product asset. USD Code and USD Search help art directors add set dressing without needing to write the code themselves. USD Search uses AI to help identify and find the assets, while USD Code helps write Python code snippets and can execute scene modification directly.
