# Augment the Content Library

*Optional*

In some cases, creators may need assets that do not already exist in their current 3D model library. USD Search, from the previous section, can help find assets that already exist in your content library. This helps teams reuse assets and maintain consistency across projects.

Here is a workflow to incorporate this functionality:

1. **Search for existing assets**: Use USD Search to find relevant assets in your content library.
2. **Import assets:** Use drag-and-drop or **USD Search** to locate and add assets to the scene.
3. **Apply materials**. If desired, apply the white materials to lean on just the shape of the objects or apply basic materials to help influence the AI, depending on the creator's goals.
4. **Position and transform**. Use USD Code to place and transform the assets within the scene.
