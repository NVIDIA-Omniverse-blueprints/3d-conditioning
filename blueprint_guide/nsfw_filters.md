# Not Safe For Work Filtering

This Blueprint utilizes a ComfyUI node to block Not Safe For Work(NSFW) images being created.  Additional safeguards can be implemented such as Aegis NIM or other means, either on the resulting images or directly where the prompts are being entered. This is something you as a developer are responsible for.
